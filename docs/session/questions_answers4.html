      Mindfulness involves:<br>
      Focusing your attention on the present,
      recognizing the emotional state you’re in,
      meditating to reduce stress and help you relax
      Find a focus object
      For example, you may notice how the hand on the clock jerks when it ticks, and that it’s slightly lopsided. Describe the patterns, color, shapes, and size of the object to yourself. Focus all your energy on this object, and your panic symptoms may subside.
