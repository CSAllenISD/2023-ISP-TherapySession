# 2023-ISP-TherapySession

## Description
> Our ISP will be a website made of Java code that counsels people about mental health issues and gives them advice. The code will be interactive that collects data from the user while keeping anonymous with the session. At the end, based on their question, we'll give you a specific answer that best fits their problem. It will also be very polished with animations and have many question options to enlighten users. We can even design a mascot for our website.
